/**
 * The FileSystemCacheKey class is a utility for creating cache keys based on various
 * SCM (Source Code Management) related objects within the Jenkins Pipeline ecosystem.
 * This key is intended to uniquely identify a cache entry based on SCM configurations
 * and the owner of the pipeline execution.
 *
 * <p>It overrides the {@link #equals(Object)} and {@link #hashCode()} methods to ensure
 * that cache keys are properly compared and can be used effectively in hash-based collections.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class is used in caching scenarios to avoid re-fetching or recalculating information
 * that has already been retrieved from the SCM system during a Jenkins pipeline execution.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Fields:</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code owner} - The {@link FlowExecutionOwner} that represents the owner of the flow execution.</li>
 *   <li>{@code scm} - The {@link SCM} instance that represents the source code management system in use.</li>
 *   <li>{@code scmSource} - The {@link SCMSource} which defines the SCM source for the project.</li>
 *   <li>{@code scmHead} - The {@link SCMHead} that identifies the branch, tag, or other head in the SCM repository.</li>
 *   <li>{@code scmRevision} - The {@link SCMRevision} that represents the revision of the SCM head.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Methods:</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #equals(Object)} - Compares this cache key with another object for equality, based on the owner, SCM, and related fields.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #hashCode()} - Generates a hash code based on the owner, SCM, and related fields for use in hash-based collections.</li>
 * </ul>
