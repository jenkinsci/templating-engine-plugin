# Overview

Hey there :wave:!

Welcome to the **Concepts** section of the documentation. This is where you'll find descriptions of everything JTE can do.

## Getting Started

Everyone learns differently.

If you'd prefer to start learning JTE by translating what you know from an existing set of pipelines, check out the [bottom-up explanation](./bottom-up.md).

If you'd rather just dive right in and have written Jenkins pipelines before, perhaps the [top-down explanation](./top-down.md) is a better fit for you.

If you learn best by watching videos, the following CDF Webinar is a great place to start.
