# Pipeline Initialization

Pipeline Initialization is the term JTE uses to describe everything that happens from when a Pipeline Run is started to when the Pipeline starts.

## Overview

This stages of Pipeline Initialization are described in the table and picture below.

| Pipeline Template Compiled         | The groovy Pipeline Template is compiled into the final form that will be executed the same way as any other Jenkinsfile                                                              |

## Pipeline Configuration Aggregation

During the Pipeline Configuration Aggregation phase, JTE fetches the [Pipeline Configuration][config] from each [Governance Tier][gov-tier] (if present) in the [Configuration Hierarchy][hierarchy].

These Pipeline Configurations are then sequentially merged, according to the procedure outlined in [Merging Pipeline Configurations](../pipeline-configuration/merging-configs.md).

The result of this process is an aggregated Pipeline Configuration for the Pipeline Run.
The [Map][map] representation of the aggregated Pipeline Configuration is made available via the [`pipelineConfig` Autowired Variable][pipelineConfig].

## Pipeline Primitives Injected

This next phase of Pipeline Initialization takes the aggregated Pipeline Configuration and parses it to create [Pipeline Primitives][primitives].

This happens by passing the aggregated Pipeline Configuration to a series of Template Primitive Injectors.
Each Pipeline Primitive has a corresponding Template Primitive Injector that reads the aggregated Pipeline Configuration and creates the corresponding Pipeline Primitives.

The Pipeline Primitives created during this phase are stored on the [Pipeline Primitive Namespace][primitive-namespace].

!!! important
    You may remember from reading the [Pipeline Configuration Syntax][config-syntax] that JTE's Pipeline Configuration DSL is just a dynamic builder language, meaning that it will accept any configurations it is given.
    The only reason `application_environments` *does anything* is because there is a Template Primitive Injector that specifically looks for that block.

## Pipeline Template Determined

Next, JTE determines the [Pipeline Template][template] based on the process outlined in [Pipeline Template Selection][template-selection].

## Pipeline Template Compiled

Finally, the determined Pipeline Template is compiled.

JTE performs some [Compile-Time Metaprogramming][compile-time-mp] to wrap the Pipeline Template in a Try-Catch-Finally block so that the [Lifecycle Hooks][hooks] can be executed before and after Pipeline Template Execution.

This compiled Pipeline is then executed **just like any other Jenkinsfile**.

!!! example "Pipeline Template Compilation"
    JTE performs compile-time metaprogramming to slightly manipulate the Pipeline Template.
    What follows is an example to understand the transformation that takes place.

    === "Provided Pipeline Template"
        ``` groovy title="Jenkinsfile"
        build()
        ```
    === "Compiled Pipeline Template"
        ``` groovy title="Jenkinsfile"
        try{
          // code that invokes @Validation annotated methods in steps
          // code that invokes @Init annotated methods in steps 
          build() // <-- original Pipeline Template
        } finally {
          // code that invokes @CleanUp annotated methods in steps
          // code that invokes @Notify annotated methods in steps
        }
        ```
