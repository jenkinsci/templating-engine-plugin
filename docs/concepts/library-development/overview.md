# Overview

Pipeline Libraries are the foundation of the Jenkins Templating Engine to allow [Pipeline Templates](../pipeline-templates/overview.md) to be shared across teams.

Libraries provide [steps](../pipeline-primitives/steps.md) that can be invoked from templates.

## Loading Libraries

The `libraries{}` block within the [Pipeline Configuration](../pipeline-configuration/overview.md) defines which libraries will be loaded for a particular Pipeline Run.
