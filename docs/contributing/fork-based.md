# Fork-Based Contribution Model

Regardless of whether you're contributing to the docs or the code, JTE follows a fork-based contribution model.

Also called a [Fork and Pull Model][1], it works through contributors [Forking][2] the [main JTE repository][3].

Contributors work on feature branches in their own forks and, when ready, submit a [Pull Request][4] back to the main JTE repository.
