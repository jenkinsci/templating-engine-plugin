# Overview

The Contributing section will help you get started with JTE development.

The contributing docs have been broken into two sections: 

| Section | Description |
|---------|------------|
| [Docs](./docs.md) | How to contribute to these docs | 
| [Developer Docs](./developer/overview.md) | How to get started developing JTE |

## Fork-Based Contribution Model

Regardless of whether you're contributing to the docs or the code, JTE follows a fork-based contribution model.

Also called a [Fork and Pull Model](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models#fork-and-pull-model), it works through contributors [Forking](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) the [main JTE repository](https://github.com/jenkinsci/templating-engine-plugin).

Contributors work on feature branches in their own forks and, when ready, submit a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) back to the main JTE repository.
