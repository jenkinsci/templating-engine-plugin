== Creating a Library

Creating a Library is as easy as creating a root level directory within your configured Library Source's source code repository.

An example repository structure could be:

[source,]
----
example_library/
----

The library is named and is referenceable by the directory name.

== Creating a Step

To create a step, create a `.groovy` file within the library directory. The step name will be that of the basename of the file.

For example, to create a `build` step, add a `build.groovy` file:

[source,]
----
README.rst
example_library/
    build.groovy
----

In most cases, writing a step is done by defining a `call` method within the groovy step file created. This `call` method can take input arguments and return objects.  Within the step you can execute any old regular Jenkins pipeline code, including invoking other steps defined by loaded libraries.

Let's say you wanted this build step to run `mvn clean verify`, your `build.groovy` file could be:

[source,groovy]
----
void call(){
    node{
        sh "mvn clean verify"
    }
}
----

[NOTE]
====
Steps, like regular global variables in Jenkins Shared Libraries, can define methods other than ``call``. See an example xref:multimethod_steps.adoc[here].
====

== Load the Library

With a directory created called `example_library` within your Library Source, you can now load this library from your pipeline configuration to make the steps contained therein accessible from your pipeline template.

*pipeline_config.groovy*:

[source,groovy]
----
libraries{
    example_library
}
----

== Invoking the Step From a Template

With the `example_library` library loaded via your pipeline configuration file, you can then invoke the `build` step from a pipeline template via:

[source,groovy]
----
build()
----

which will execute the shell command defined in the step.

== Advanced Considerations

Now that you know the basics of how to create a library, populate the library with steps, reference them from your pipeline configuration file, and invoke the step from a pipeline template you can now move on to some of the more advanced library development concepts:
