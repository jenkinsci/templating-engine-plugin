# Prerequisites

## Jenkins Instance

A Jenkins instance will be required for this lab. If you don't have one available to you, we would recommend going through [Local Development Learning Lab](../local-development/index.md) to deploy a local Jenkins instance through Docker.

## JTE: Pipeline Primitives

This lab is the third and final lab specifically dedicated to the Jenkins Templating Engine's functionality.

Please be sure to have completed the [Pipeline Primitives Learning Lab](../jte-primitives/index.md) before attempting this one, as we will be picking up where that lab leaves off.
